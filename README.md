# flood-fill

Simple code for testing the flood fill algorithm for maze solving.

This code is old and ugly, use it at your own risk. I was just using it to find
out the errors in my flood fill implementation. At first this was command line
only, but later I brutally injected some quick visualization in Qt. There are no 
command line arguments. If you have enough courage, look through the code and 
modify variables there. Or maybe even rewrite it :)

Make sure that you have installed `requirements.txt`, e.g.
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For text-based visualization:
```
python maze.py
```

For graphical visualization:
```
python gui.py
```
