# flood-fill

Simple code for testing the flood fill algorithm for maze solving.

This code is old and ugly, use it at your own risk. I was just using it to find
out the errors in my flood fill implementation. At first this was command line
only, later I brutally injected quick visualization in Qt. There are no command
line argumnets. If you have enough courage, look through the code and modify
variables there. Or rewrite it :)
variables there. Or rewrite it :)

Make sure that you have installed `requirements.txt`, e.g.
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For text-based visualization:
```
python maze.py
```

For graphical visualization:
```
python gui.py
```
